# My Server Setup

## Environment
- Ubuntu Server 24.04

## Docker Containers in Use
- Jellyfin  
- qBittorrent  
- Sonarr  
- Radarr  
- Prowlarr  
- Portainer  
- Minecraft Server

## Usage Notes
- It’s recommended to use private trackers with Prowlarr, but free trackers should work fine as well!  
- All services are running inside Docker containers — a recommended approach for easy management.  
- I primarily use Portainer to manage containers since I’m not a Docker expert.  

## Current Status
This server is a work in progress and currently acts as a replacement for my host machine. I’m experimenting with running everything inside a VM.

## Planned Features 
- Prometheus monitoring (installed, still in need of tinkering)  
- Server home page (probably using Homer)
